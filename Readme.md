# Arithmetic Expressions as Tree

This program puts arithmetic expressions like 3+5 * 6 - 1 into a tree structure.
Therefore, it consists of an Tree class, which manages all the single nodes and is responsible for the overal structure and results.
The objects to be managed are different types of nodes, depending on the arithmetic operations they represent.
Those nodes are stored within the tree class.

Tried to create a program structure which seems to make sense to me regarding the folder structure and so on - feel free to reach out to me with hints how to do better.

Enjoy putting your math expressions into tree structure.
